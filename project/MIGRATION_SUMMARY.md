# Database Migration Summary

## Overview

We've successfully created a set of migration files that represent the current database schema in a way that follows Supabase best practices. The migrations are properly formatted with timestamps and can be applied sequentially to recreate the entire database.

## Created Migration Files

We've created three main migration files:

1. **Initial Schema Migration** - `20250309101430_initial_schema.sql`

   - Creates all tables and their relationships
   - Defines custom enum types (`booking_status` and `user_role`)
   - Creates the `handle_new_user` function and associated trigger
   - Sets up proper foreign key constraints

2. **RLS Policies Migration** - `20250309101502_enable_rls_policies.sql`

   - Enables Row Level Security on all tables
   - Defines policies for viewing and modifying data based on user roles
   - Implements appropriate security restrictions

3. **Seed Data Migration** - `20250309101531_seed_data.sql`
   - Provides initial data for service categories
   - Creates a set of predefined services with descriptions and pricing
   - Defines service areas with location information

## Verification Process

We've verified the migrations are correctly formatted by using the `supabase migration list` command. The command successfully recognizes our migration files, confirming they follow the expected naming convention and structure.

## Next Steps

1. **Clean up old migration files**: There appear to be older migration files in the directory that should be reviewed and potentially removed to avoid confusion:

   - `20250309100703_initial_schema.sql`
   - `20250309100806_seed_data.sql`
   - `schema.sql`
   - `seed.sql`

2. **Docker setup**: Before the migrations can be applied, Docker Desktop needs to be properly configured. Currently, there appears to be an issue with Docker connectivity that's preventing the `supabase db reset` command from working correctly.

3. **Apply migrations**: Once Docker is properly configured, run the `supabase db reset` command to apply all migrations and verify they work as expected.

4. **Documentation**: The README.md has been updated with instructions on migration application and verification steps for future reference.

## Database Schema Structure

The migrations create a comprehensive database schema with the following components:

### Core Tables

- `profiles` - Basic user information
- `customer_profiles` - Customer-specific details
- `provider_profiles` - Service provider details
- `admin_profiles` - Admin user information

### Service Management

- `service_categories` - Categories for grouping services
- `services` - Individual service offerings
- `service_areas` - Geographic regions where services are available
- `provider_services` - Services offered by specific providers

### Booking System

- `bookings` - Service booking records
- `payment_transactions` - Financial transaction records
- `reviews` - Customer feedback on completed services
- `notifications` - System notifications for users
- `analytics_data` - Business performance metrics

### Security

- Row Level Security on all tables
- Appropriate policies based on user roles

This structure provides a solid foundation for the lawn service application while maintaining proper security and data integrity.
