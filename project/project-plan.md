- Write tests for API services
- Test Zustand stores
- Create tests for utility functions

### 5.2 End-to-End Testing (Days 3-4)

- Configure Detox for E2E testing

  - Authentication
  - Booking creation
  - Payment processing
  - Profile management

### 5.3 Performance Optimization (Day 5)

- Optimize component rendering
- Implement proper loading states
- Add data caching strategies
- Reduce bundle size

## Phase 6: Error Handling and Final Polishing (Week 6)

### 6.1 Error Handling (Days 1-2)

- Implement global error boundary
- Create consistent error UI components
- Add network error recovery
- Improve form validation errors

### 6.2 Offline Support (Days 3-4)

- Implement basic offline functionality

- Test offline/online transitions

### 6.3 Final Review and Documentation (Day 5)

- Code review across all components
- Fix any remaining issues
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Prepare for deployment

## Implementation Strategy

For each phase, the implementation approach will:

1. Create detailed implementation plans before starting
2. Focus on one feature at a time
3. Maintain backwards compatibility
4. Follow the existing code patterns
5. Write tests for new functionality
6. Request review at the completion of each phase

This approach ensures we maintain a working application throughout the development process while incrementally improving the codebase.
